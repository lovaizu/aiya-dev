## Problem Summary

The workflow, issue format, and PR format rules have a known gap: PR Tasks are not verified against Success Criteria, causing rework at step 9. A comprehensive expert review is needed to find this and any other gaps.

## Approach

1. Perform a development process expert review of workflow.md, issue-format.md, and pr-format.md
2. Analyze the traceability chain: Pain → Approach → Tasks ↔ Success Criteria → Benefit
3. Document all findings
4. Apply improvements to the rule files

## Key Decisions

- Focus on traceability gaps (the known gap category) and structural issues
- Avoid over-engineering: only fix gaps that cause real problems, not hypothetical ones
- Keep changes minimal and targeted

## Open Questions

None — the scope is well-defined by the issue.
