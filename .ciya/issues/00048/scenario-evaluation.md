# Scenario Evaluation

| AS | Status | Method | Judgment |
|----|--------|--------|----------|
| AS1 | OK | Inspected | Cannot execute because `/hi` is a Claude Code slash command requiring an interactive session. Inspected `.claude/commands/hi.md`. The skill creates issues via `gh issue create` with no worktree-type check. As a developer, running `/hi` in any worktree triggers the hearing process and creates an issue. Then is satisfied. |
| AS2 | OK | Inspected | Cannot execute because `/ok` requires an interactive session with GitHub API access. Inspected `.claude/commands/ok.md`. The skill accepts an issue/PR number, resolves it, and starts or resumes implementation with no worktree-type conditional. As a developer, running `/ok 42` in any worktree starts or resumes implementation. Then is satisfied. |
| AS3 | OK | Inspected | Cannot execute because this requires running the full Gate 1 flow interactively. Inspected `.claude/commands/ty.md` Gate 1 section. When no PR exists, the agent says "Issue approved. Run `/ok <number>` to start implementation." The workflow ends — no automatic transition to implementation. As a developer, after approving at Gate 1, the workflow ends with a prompt to run `/ok`. Then is satisfied. |
| AS4 | OK | Executed | As a developer, examined installed skills at `.claude/commands/`. Found `ok.md` and `hi.md` as separate files. `/ok` exists as its own skill, distinct from `/hi`. Then is satisfied. |
| AS5 | OK | Inspected | Cannot execute because verifying absence of conditionals requires reading source. Inspected `hi.md`, `ok.md`, `ty.md`, `bb.md`, and `fb.md`. No worktree-type detection (`basename` check against `main`) or conditional branching on worktree type exists. `ok.md` and `ty.md` use `basename` only to derive the base branch name dynamically, which works identically in any worktree. Then is satisfied. |
| AS6 | OK | Inspected | Cannot execute because verifying documentation requires reading the file. Inspected `README.md`. The workflow diagram shows a single linear flow with no worktree-based subgraphs. Commands table has no "Where" column. Usage examples show unified commands. "How it works" says "use either command in any pane." Then is satisfied. |
| AS7 | OK | Inspected | Cannot execute because the full workflow requires an interactive session with a live developer. Inspected the workflow path: `/hi` creates issue → `/ty` Gate 1 ends with "Run `/ok`" → `/ok N` creates branch/PR → `/ty` Gate 2 starts implementation → `/ty` Gate 3 merges. All cross-references between commands are consistent. `workflow.md` confirms the same flow. Then is satisfied. |
