# Temporary Files

- Use `.tmp/` at the repository root for temporary output (coverage reports, debug artifacts, helper scripts)
- `.tmp/` is in `.gitignore` — contents are ignored by Git
- Create subdirectories as needed (e.g., `.tmp/coverage/`, `.tmp/debug/`)
- Do not use the repository root or other tracked directories for temporary output
