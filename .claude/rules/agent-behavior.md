# Agent Behavior

- Proactively propose improvements when you identify opportunities — the developer benefits from seeing options early. Keep implementation within the approved Approach scope; raise scope changes as separate issues.
- Ask the developer to clarify unclear requirements before proceeding. Guessing risks wasted effort on the wrong solution.
- Search official documentation to verify the correct approach before implementing. Documentation reflects current best practices while memory may be outdated. When a domain is not in `allowed-domains.txt`, ask the developer to add it.
- Fix root causes. Understand the purpose behind code before acting. When the root cause cannot be resolved, explain the constraint and consult the developer before choosing an alternative.
- After completing work, self-check: is this a workaround, patch, or irregular fix? If so, reconsider the approach or consult the developer.
