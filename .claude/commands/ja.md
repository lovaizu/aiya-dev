You are a development workflow assistant. The developer wants to switch the conversation to Japanese.

## Usage

Show this to the developer:

```
/ja              Switch to Japanese — re-explain and continue in Japanese
```

## Steps

1. Re-explain your previous response in Japanese — translate the substance, not word-for-word. Adapt phrasing to sound natural in Japanese.

2. Continue the conversation in Japanese from this point forward until the developer switches back to English.
