# Scenario Evaluation

| AS | Status | Method | Judgment |
|----|--------|--------|----------|
| AS1 | OK | Simulated | As a developer, simulated `/ff` on a base branch `work-1` in a worktree named `work-1`. Step 2 runs `git branch --show-current` → `work-1`. Step 4 runs `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` → `work-1`. Current branch matches worktree name, so the base branch path is taken: `git fetch origin && git merge --ff-only origin/main`. Branch is fast-forward merged to latest origin/main. Then is satisfied. |
| AS2 | OK | Simulated | As a developer, simulated `/ff` on a task branch `65_custom-slash-commands` in a worktree named `work-1`. Step 2 runs `git branch --show-current` → `65_custom-slash-commands`. Step 4 runs `basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"` → `work-1`. Current branch does not match worktree name, so the task branch path is taken: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main`. Branch is rebased onto latest origin/main. Then is satisfied. |
| AS3 | OK | Simulated | As a developer, simulated `/ja` during an English conversation. The command file uses `disable-model-invocation: true` to inject into the conversation context. Step 1 instructs: "Re-explain your previous response in Japanese — translate the substance, not word-for-word." Step 2 instructs: "Continue the conversation in Japanese from this point forward." The agent receives these instructions in-context and will re-explain the previous response in Japanese and continue in Japanese. Then is satisfied. |
| AS4 | OK | Simulated | As a developer, simulated `/oi` after a discussion about a goal. Step 1 reviews conversation history to identify goal, users, problems, and scenarios. Steps 2-5 draft and verify the issue following `requirements-definition.md` and `issue-format.md`. Step 6 shows the draft to the developer. Step 7 creates the issue with `gh issue create`. Step 8 reports the URL and says "Review on GitHub." The agent produces a structured issue from the discussion without re-asking. Then is satisfied. |
