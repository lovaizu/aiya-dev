# Scenario Evaluation

| AS | Status | Method | Judgment |
|----|--------|--------|----------|
| AS1 | OK | Simulated | As a skill developer, simulated running Profile mode on skill-smith itself with test prompt "evaluate my skill". Step 1 (Capture Target) would get the skill path and prompt. Step 2 (Parse Steps) would extract the 6 Evaluate steps from SKILL.md. Step 3 (Execute and Record) would launch 6 Task subagents — each returns a `<usage>` block with duration_ms, total_tokens, tool_uses. The PROFILE_METRICS line provides files_read and errors. Cost is derived from total_tokens. The report template at Step 6 includes Duration/%, Tokens/%, Cost/%, Tools/%, Reads, Errors columns — all metrics from AS1 are recorded with proportions. Then is satisfied. |
| AS2 | OK | Executed | As a skill developer, executed `profile_stats.sh` with 3 runs of simulated data: `printf '1\tduration_ms\t1500\n1\tduration_ms\t1200\n1\tduration_ms\t1800\n' | bash scripts/profile_stats.sh` produced `1 duration_ms 1500.00 1500.00 244.95 1200.00 1800.00 1.0000` — average (1500), median (1500), stddev (244.95), min (1200), max (1800) are all present. Profile Step 4 instructs using this script to compute statistics per step per metric. Then is satisfied. |
| AS3 | OK | Simulated | As a skill developer, simulated requesting analysis after profiling runs. Step 5 (Analyze Bottlenecks) defines the >30% threshold for bottleneck identification and a classification table mapping bottleneck types (Token-heavy, Slow, Tool-heavy, Error-prone, Read-heavy) to concrete improvement suggestions. Instruction 3 explicitly requires suggestions tied to actual step content ("Step 3 reads 12 files individually; batch with a single Glob pattern"). The report template includes a Bottlenecks section with step identification, percentage, and concrete suggestion. Then is satisfied. |
